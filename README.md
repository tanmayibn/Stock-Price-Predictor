# Stock-Price-Predictor

This project is designed for stock price prediction.


# Technologies Used:

Python: The primary programming language for the project.
Keras: A deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
scikit-learn: A machine learning library for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
NumPy: A library for numerical computations and data manipulation.
Matplotlib: A data visualization library for creating charts and plots.
Pandas: A data manipulation library for handling structured data.
OpenBB: An external library used for loading stock price and financial data.
MinMaxScaler: A preprocessing technique from scikit-learn used for feature scaling.
Project Workflow:



# The project follows these key steps:

Data loading from historical AAPL stock price data using the OpenBB library.
Data preprocessing, including feature engineering and label creation.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Normalizing the data with Min-Max scaling.
Building and training different machine learning models:
SimpleRNN model.
LSTM model.
Feedforward Neural Network model.
Model evaluation using mean squared error (MSE) on the test data.
Visualization of predicted vs. actual stock prices.
Calculation of accuracy based on prediction accuracy.


# Project Goal:

The main objective of the project is to forecast future AAPL stock prices based on historical data and assess the accuracy of these predictions using mean squared error.


# Usage:

Users can adapt this project to predict stock prices for other companies by modifying the code for data loading and preprocessing.


# Results:

The project provides quantitative and visualized results for the performance of different machine learning models in predicting stock prices.
